        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          My first video was I ate a Cockroach “for the views” garnering 100. 
          Invigorated, I pumped out more content, releasing I Buried Myself Alive and I Won Fortnite Running. 
          Originally, I hid my channel as a secret indulgence but soon my school found out. 
          Still filled with aspiration, I filmed somebody else, leaving me safely out of the limelight. 
          I stole my iPhone into cross country practice, documenting the hijinks of our neighborhood jaunts. 
          Over a 3-month process of editing 1 hour per day, I made The Caleb Movie. 
          My movie made me realize I was capable of something cool.

          I’ve wanted to work for you since I was a kid, mailing an over 9000-word letter to see if I could. 
          But at 15, my dad enlisted me to work at Galt Valley Ranch. The hard work crushed my dreams. 
          As I logged more hours, gone were my days of a Youtuber and in with my new cowboy identity. 
          Picking fields M-F, 8-12AM let me critically think and fulfill my plans back home. 
          9 months I took a 3-hour practice test, 6 months filling paperwork for non-profits, and 3 months sparring with my nemesis. 
          By end of senior year, I earned a 34 on my ACT, became an Eagle Scout, and made State wrestling.
